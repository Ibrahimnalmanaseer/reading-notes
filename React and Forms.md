# React and Forms

---


### What is a Controlled Component?
An input form element whose value combined in single state by react .


### Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

as the state and setState() are combined and they will have the same vlue , no need to wait the user to subimt .


### How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

 the inputâ€™s value is always driven by the React state and stored in it .



### Why would we use a ternary operator?
to short our code and to run faster.


### Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

const adults = age >= 21 ? "big boy" : " still young";
