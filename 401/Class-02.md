## Testing and Modules

### Unit Test and TDD

unit test is a writing code to excersize the input ,the output and code behavior .

on other way the TDD is a strategy to think and write tests:

- <h3>Baby Steps</h3>:
 Do a smallest test on the feature by insert input and return output,inoder to achieve it we should know what to test and what is excpecetd ,
the test file should follow the same name of module name.
Other thing to care about is the structure. A convention widely used is the AAA: Arrange, Act and Assert.
   - Arrange: orgnize the input data;
   - Act: excersize the behavior and sxcute the code.
   - Assert: check if the output is the same as you were expecting.

- <h3>The Cycle </h3>
  The cycle is made by three steps:

    ðŸ†˜ Write a unit test and make it fail.
    
    âœ… Write the feature and make the test pass.
    
    ðŸ”µ Refactor the code
