# Stack and Queue

## Stack :
Stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.

Push the item into the stack, and pop the item out of the stack. 

A stack is a limited access data structure - elements can be added and removed from the stack only at the top


## Queue :

Queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.

In the queue only two operations are allowed enqueue and dequeue. 
Enqueue means to insert an item into the back of the queue, dequeue means removing the front item.
