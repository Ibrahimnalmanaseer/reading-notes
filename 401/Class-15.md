# Tree 


## Tree Data Structure

Trees are non-linear data structures that represent nodes connected by edges. Each tree consists of a root node as the Parent node, and the left node and right node as Child nodes.

## Why Tree Data Structure?

tree data structures allow quicker and easier access to the data more than the linear data structures .

## Tree Terminologies

- **Node:** A node is an entity that contains a key or value and pointers to its child nodes.
- **Edge:** It is the link between any two nodes.
- **Root:** It is the topmost node of a tree.
- **Height of a Node:** The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest node.
- **Depth of a Node:** The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.
