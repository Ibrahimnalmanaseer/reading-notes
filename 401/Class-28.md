# Authentication & Production Server

## JSON Web Tokens

### What is JSON Web Token?

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

### When should you use JSON Web Tokens?

- **Authorization** : Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token.
- **Information Exchange**: securely transmitting information between parties,using public/private key pairsâ€”you can be sure the senders are who they say they are.

### What is the JSON Web Token structure?

In its compact form, JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:

- Header
- Payload
- Signature

**As below format:**

`xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz`



### How do JSON Web Tokens work?

Whenever the user wants to access a protected route or resource, the user agent should send the JWT, typically in the `Authorization` header using the `Bearer` schema.
The content of the header should look like the following:

`Authorization: Bearer <token>`


The server's protected routes will check for a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header, and if it's present, the user will be allowed to access protected resources. 

The following diagram shows how a JWT is obtained and used to access APIs or resources:

- The application or client requests authorization to the authorization server. This is performed through one of the different authorization flows.
- When the authorization is granted, the authorization server returns an access token to the application.
- The application uses the access token to access a protected resource (like an API).

## Use JWT Authentication with Django REST Framework
  
### How JWT Works?
The JWT is acquired by exchanging an username + password for an access token and an refresh token.

The access token is usually short-lived (expires in 5 min or so, can be customized though).

The refresh token lives a little bit longer (expires in 24 hours, also customizable). It is comparable to an authentication session. After it expires, you need a full login with username + password again.

### Installation & Setup


`pip install djangorestframework_simplejwt`
**settings.py**

```
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.JWTAuthentication',
    ],
}
```

**urls.py**

```
from django.urls import path
from rest_framework_simplejwt import views as jwt_views

urlpatterns = [
    # Your URLs...
    path('api/token/', jwt_views.TokenObtainPairView.as_view(), name='token_obtain_pair'),
    path('api/token/refresh/', jwt_views.TokenRefreshView.as_view(), name='token_refresh'),
]
```


### Obtain Token

First step is to **authenticate and obtain the token**. The endpoint is /api/token/ and it only accepts POST requests.

`http post http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/token/ username=vitor password=123`


After that you are going to store both the access token and the refresh token on the client side, usually in the localStorage.

In order to access the protected views on the backend (i.e., the API endpoints that require authentication), you should include the access token in the header of all requests, like this:

`http http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello/ "Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzIiwiZXhwIjoxNTQ1MjI0MjAwLCJqdGkiOiJlMGQxZDY2MjE5ODc0ZTY3OWY0NjM0ZWU2NTQ2YTIwMCIsInVzZXJfaWQiOjF9.9eHat3CvRQYnb5EdcgYFzUyMobXzxlAVh_IAgqyvzCE"`

### Refresh Token

To get a new access token, you should use the refresh token endpoint `/api/token/refresh/` posting the refresh token:

`http post http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/token/refresh/ refresh=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoicmVmcmVzaCIsImV4cCI6MTU0NTMwODIyMiwianRpIjoiNzAyOGFlNjc0ZTdjNDZlMDlmMzUwYjg3MjU1NGUxODQiLCJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxfQ.Md8AO3dDrQBvWYWeZsd_A1J39z6b6HEwWIUZ7ilOiPE`
