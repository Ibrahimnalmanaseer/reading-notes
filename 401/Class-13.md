# Serverless Functions

## What is Serverless?
Serverless is a cloud computing application development and execution model that enables developers to build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure.

## Serverless Services

- **Function-as-a-service :** cloud computing service that enables developers to run code or containers in response to specific events or requests, without specifying or managing the infrastructure required to run to code.
- **databases and storage :** Transitioning away from provisioning “instances” with defined capacity, connection and query limits, and moving toward models that scale linearly with demand in both infrastructure and pricing.
- **Event streaming and messaging** 
- **API gateways:** API gateways act as proxies to web actions and provide HTTP method routing, client ID and secrets, rate limits, CORS, viewing API usage, viewing response logs, and API sharing policies.


## Pros and cons of serverless

### Pros

- **Improved developer productivity:** serverless enables development teams to focus on writing code, not managing infrastructure. It gives developers much more time to innovate and optimize their front-end application functionality.
- **Pay for execution only:** The meter starts when the request is made, and ends when execution finishes.
- **Develop in any language**
- **Cost-effective performance:** can be both faster and more cost-effective than other forms of compute.


### Cons

- **Unacceptable latency for certain applications:** For many applications the resultant delay would not be detrimental or even noticeable to users. But for others—say, a financial trading application—this cold-start latency might be unacceptable.
- **Higher costs for stable or predictable workloads:**
- **Monitoring and debugging issues:** difficult or impossible to monitor or debug serverless functions using existing tools or processes.


## Use cases for serverless

- **Use cases for serverless** 
- **API backends**
- **Data processing**
- **Massively parallel compute/“Map” operations**
- **Stream processing workloads**
