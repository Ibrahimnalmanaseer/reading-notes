# Intro to Python :

### Big O Notation :

Big o notation is a way to evaluate how efficiency and performance of your code, we can use it in data structure and algorithms,
by checking how much time takes to execute the algorithm and how much space in memory it's needed,there is two types of Big O equations are O(1) and O(n),
An O(1) function takes constant time, which is to say that it doesn’t matter how many elements we have, or how huge our input is, it’ll always take the same amount of time and memory to run our algorithm
O(n) function is linear, which means that as our input grows (from ten numbers, to ten thousand, to ten million), the space and time that we need to run that algorithm grows linearly.


### Names and Values in Python

Python is really simple language , mechanisim is very simple.

Python facts :
- Names refer to values: assignemnt makes names refer to vlue .
- Many names can refer to one value: exp (x = 5, y=x).
-  Names reassigned independantly:
